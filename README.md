# conformer
These are the models used in Keith Downing's ALife Journal paper (2023): 
  "The Evolution of Conformity, Malleability and Influence in Simulated Online Agents"
To run these files, you will need Python 3.9 or better, and you will need to install matplotlib and tensorflow.
The code is commented, but mainly for my (Keith) own benefit, although comments at the top of conformer2.py should
give you enough to actually run the code and produce similar results to those presented in the paper.  If you are
seriously interested in how it all works and have trouble understanding the code, feel free to contact me (email = keithd@ntnu.no)
and I can try to explain it via a quick zoom call.
